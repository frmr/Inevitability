<h2>Inevitability</h2>

Inevitability is a game that a friend (Aryn Clark) and I made in three days for Molyjam 2013. The quote used as inspiration was: *"If you love your dog, we're gonna mess with your mind, man. You're not going to be able to go to bed."*

You are Milo, as he tries hopelessly to save his loyal companion Lily from the inevitable grip of death. This is the most emotional game of Snake you will ever play.

I did the programming, Aryn did the art, and I think it came out alright considering the time we did it in. There was some interesting feedback from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFA8I9F9am4) gentleman. I'm not sure he got all the jokes, but fair play, he's a cracking Snake player.

Enjoy!
